Instead he, along with Joseph, have obtained Stands; a physical manifestation of one's fighting spirit. Joseph reveals to Jotaro that Dio had survived and had stolen Jonathan's body as his own, running amok somewhere in the world.

            <h3>About Dio</h3>
            <p>Dio is the overarching antagonist of the series and is the lifelong enemy of the Joestar lineage. Born in the slums of London, Dio had a hellish upbringing; severely abused by his father, and playing chess competitively to have enough money to feed himself. Dio felt like an underdog throughout his life and that he needs to fight tooth and nail to get to the top of society. His golden opportunity came when his father handed him a letter from his father that is addressed to the Joestar family. Dio's father told him to go to them upon his death for a better life. Dio was adopted into the Joestar family and immediately proceeded to make Jonathan's life a living hell. Embarassing him in a boxing match, spreading rumors, even killing Jonathan's dog, there's no line Dio wouldn't cross to break Jonathan's spirit. Once Jonathan fought back, Dio decided to be more sublte with his actions. Upon adulthood, Dio developed a comradere with Jonathan, which was only a facade. Dio's true motivation was to steal the Joestar family fortune for himself by poisoning Jonathan's father George and murdering Jonathan afterwards. Jonathan caught wind of his plans and started investigating, forcing Dio to run off with the stone mask. Dio learned that the mask turns the user into a vampire using blood and saved it for a backup plan. Upon returning to the Joestar manor, Jonathan, his new friend Speedwagon, and 6 policemen were there to meet Dio. backed into a corner, Dio stabbed George and used his blood to activate the stone mask, transforming into a vampire and slaying everyone within the manor. Jonathan and Dio's battle ended in a stalemate, and Dio survived the burning of the Manor and took refuge in a village, turning everyone into zombies and consuming many souls to regenerate. Dio's second battle with Jonathan ended with Dio cutting off his own head in a long fall. Dio then stowed himself away on Jonathan and Erina's cruise ship, turned evryone on the ship into zombies, and fatally wounded Jonathan to steal his body.<br><br>
            Dio survived the destruction of the ship and slept in a coffin at the bottom of the Atlantic ocean for 100 years. Upon reakwakening, Dio was a new man; more philisophical and inquisitive about life and his own psychological nature. He met a young man named Pucci and the two quickly became friends, discussing many topics about philisoph, art and more. This was where Dio impressed upon Pucci the idea of reaching Heaven, a state of enlightenment where everyone knows their fate and can make peace with it, freeing themselves from desitny's uncertainty. <br> In the year 1988, Dio declared war on the Joestar family once again and had newfound motivation to erase them from this world; he sent many assassins and minions after Jotaro's group to prevent them from reaching Dio, but Jotaro and his group defeated them all. Once the group reached Cairo, Dio stopped at nothing to kill them using his Stand, The World, which has the ability to stop time. Dio used his power to kill both Kakyoin and Joseph, along with wounding Polnareff. Dio and Jotaro proceeded to fight throughout Cairo, but eventually Jotaro got the upper hand even after Dio consumed Joseph's blood to enhance his powers. Dio was killed by Jotaro and his body disintergrated upon sunrise.
